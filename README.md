# Rocket Trajectory Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the trajectory of a rocket using classical mechanics, specifically Newton’s laws of motion.  
It is designed as an educational and exploratory project to understand how forces such as thrust, gravity, and air resistance affect rocket motion.

## Physics Model
The simulation is based on:
- Newton’s Second Law: **F = m · a**
- Gravitational force
- Thrust force generated by the rocket engine
- Optional air drag (to be added in future versions)

The motion is computed by numerically integrating the equations of motion over time.

## Objectives
- Apply classical mechanics concepts to a real-world problem
- Develop a basic physics-based simulation using code
- Visualize the rocket trajectory with graphs
- Build a foundation for more advanced aerospace simulations

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Future Improvements
- Add variable mass (fuel consumption)
- Include air resistance and wind
- Extend the model to 2D and 3D trajectories
- Compare numerical and analytical solutions

## Author
Student with interest in physics, aerospace engineering, and scientific computing.
