# Rocket Trajectory Simulation

This project simulates the vertical trajectory of a rocket using Newton’s laws of motion.
The model compares an ideal case without air resistance to a more realistic case including aerodynamic drag.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to understand how different physical forces affect the motion of a rocket.
By comparing an ideal model with a realistic one, the project highlights the importance of aerodynamic effects in aerospace engineering.

## Physics Background

The simulation is based on Newton’s second law of motion:

- Thrust force generated by the rocket engine
- Gravitational force acting downward
- Aerodynamic drag force proportional to the square of the velocity

The equations of motion are solved numerically using small time steps to simulate the rocket’s trajectory over time.

## Model Comparison

Two simulations were performed:
- One assuming ideal conditions without air resistance
- One including aerodynamic drag

The comparison shows that air resistance significantly reduces the maximum altitude reached by the rocket.
This demonstrates how aerodynamic forces play a crucial role in realistic aerospace modeling.

## Tools Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Apogee Analysis

The maximum height (apogee) and the time required to reach it were computed for both models.
The results show that aerodynamic drag not only reduces the maximum altitude but also affects the time to reach the apogee.
This analysis demonstrates how energy losses due to air resistance influence real rocket trajectories.
