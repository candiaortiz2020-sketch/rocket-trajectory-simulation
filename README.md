# Rocket Trajectory Simulation

This project simulates the vertical trajectory of a rocket using Newton’s laws of motion.
The model compares an ideal case without air resistance to a more realistic case including aerodynamic drag.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to understand how different physical forces affect the motion of a rocket.
By comparing an ideal model with a realistic one, the project highlights the importance of aerodynamic effects in aerospace engineering.

## Physics Background

The simulation is based on Newton’s second law of motion:

- Thrust force generated by the rocket engine
- Gravitational force acting downward
- Aerodynamic drag force proportional to the square of the velocity

The equations of motion are solved numerically using small time steps to simulate the rocket’s trajectory over time.

## Model Comparison

Two simulations were performed:
- One assuming ideal conditions without air resistance
- One including aerodynamic drag

The comparison shows that air resistance significantly reduces the maximum altitude reached by the rocket.
This demonstrates how aerodynamic forces play a crucial role in realistic aerospace modeling.
